## Project Overview

This project use the [Covid-19 data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/) from owid github page. This data is collect daily and show each country Covid data like death, positive case, vaccinated etc.
We will store the data in [SQL server management studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?). After download and procees using [Python Script](/Main.ipynb) with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package.
And connect to sql database using [SQL Alchemy](https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/) and [Pyodbc](https://pypi.org/project/pyodbc/) for connection. In this project I aim to store the data in SQL server by using a [store procedure](sql/sp/) to load in the data.
And create [view](sql/view) for further data anylysis. We will also explore the data with select [query](sql/query) to see the currenct situation of the Covid in each country 


## Prerequisite
